## black-hole

Black holes, mysterious and grand, ormed from stars that have reached the end. Their gravity, a pull so fierce and true that even light cannot break through.
An event horizon, invisible but there a boundary beyond which none can dare. For within lies a realm of infinite might where physics and time lose their sight.
